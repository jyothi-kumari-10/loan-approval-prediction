Loan Approval Prediction using Decision Trees
Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details. The objective is to support financial institutions in making faster and data-driven lending decisions.

Technologies Used

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
The dataset contains applicant information such as income, loan amount, credit history, and employment details.
Data preprocessing steps were applied to handle missing values and categorical variables.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Encoded categorical variables
Normalized/standardized numerical features

Model Development

Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier
Trained and validated using Scikit-learn

Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Feature importance analysis to identify key approval factors

Results

The Decision Tree model achieved high accuracy on the test set.
Key features influencing approvals included applicant income, loan amount, and credit history.
